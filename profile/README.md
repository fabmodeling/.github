General info about the FabModeling organization

FabModeling aims to help developper design artefacts by documenting the fabrication process and its variability.

It aims to :
- enforce sustainability; by reuse
- help manage variability ( asset/component, process)
- expose example fabrication projects
- be versatile, as much as possible, allow the use of any tooling
- educates; help learning by exposing the fabrication steps and choice

This organization is driven by: Inria, IRISA, Universit√© de Rennes... and more specifically, driven by the following research teams : DiverSE, PACAP
